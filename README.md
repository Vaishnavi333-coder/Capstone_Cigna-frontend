# Frontend - InsureConnect Client Servicing Portal

This is the React frontend for the client servicing portal.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies

```
cd frontend
npm install
```

2. Start the dev server

```
npm run dev
```

3. Visit http://localhost:3001

The frontend expects the backend API to be running at the URL defined in `.env` as `VITE_API_BASE`, which defaults to `http://localhost:3000/api`.
